Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory? 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums){
        int a = 0;
        for (int n : nums){
            a ^= n;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```
the last one standing is single one.
